In this repository you can find a little project about the creation of PetStore user in API.

First you should clone this project by following the steps below:
1) Click the green button with "<> Code" on it.
2) Then you find the link for the project, please copy it.
3) Open your IDE (I use IntelliJ) , create a new project by choosing "Project from Version Control".
4) Paste the link you copied into URL input.
5) Click clone.
6) Click "Trust project" in the opening window.
7) Click on the project name, under src folder you can find test folder.
8) Click java folder in order to see the classes and codes.
9) In "PetStoreBaseUrl" class I setup the base url and content type in order to keep my actual test class clean.
10) In "CreatePetStoreUser" class I send a post request to the endpoint to create a user and I do assertions to make sure I created user successfully.
11) If you want to work on the project please create your own branch and type codes, please do not work on the main branch in order to prevent errors, conflicts.

Hope this guide is helpful for you.
